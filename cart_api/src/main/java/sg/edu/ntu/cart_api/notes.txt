Explain the use of these annotations:

Group 1:
- @SpringBootApplication: First touchpoint of the application, 
                            wire up all other annotations together.
                            Main engine.
- @RestController: Takes in incoming request and response (API Calls)
- @Service: Backend Logics, data comes from repository
- @Component: The parent of @Service, @RestController, etcs

Group 2:
- @RequestMapping - allow you to design the signature of your API endpoint
                        path, method, content-type
- @RequestBody - input parameters of the functionalites, 
                    in the form of .json
- @ResponseBody - output parameters of the functionalities, 
                    in the form of .json

Group 3:
- @PathVariable Use to extract the value of the path  
                        and assign their value to a method parameter

- @Bean is used to explicitly declare a single bean, rather 
                        than letting Spring do it 
                        automatically as above. It decouples the 
                        declaration of the bean from the class definition, 
                        and lets you create and configure beans exactly how you 
                        choose.

- @Value used at the field or method/constructor parameter level,  
                        used to inject values from properties files, 
                        environment variables, or command line arguments 
                        into a Spring-managed bean.
                        
- @Autowired used for automatic dependency injection,






1. Boot up the spring boot container
- @SpringBootApplication
- @SpringBootConfiguration
- @Bean
- @Component

2. Spring boot container in runtime
- @Autowired

3. Destroy container
